# Final_Project

## Full Moon Births Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to use relational databases, machine learning models, and a data visualization platform to help us see and understand the relationship between births and the lunar cycle.  Using the supervised machine learning language tool we will able to identify if, and how strong of a correlation exists between US births and the lunar cycle. Identifying how strong of a relationship exists could result in predicting when children are more likely to be born in a given month.
