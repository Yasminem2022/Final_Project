# Final_Project

## Births Analysis Based on Day of Week and Month
The primary objective of this project is to use relational databases, machine learning models, and a data visualization platform to help us see and understand the relationship between births and the day of the week and month.  Using the supervised machine learning language tool we will be able to identify if, and how strong of a correlation exists between US births and the day of the week and month.  Our goal is to build a machine learning tool that can predict the number of births on a given day of the week and in a given month.  Identifying how strong of a relationship exists could result in predicting when children are more likely to be born on a given day, week or month, and furthermore when parents can expect hospitals to be more full.

## Deliverables
- **Presentation**: Our final presentation will include our topic, the reason as to why we chose our topic, description of our data source, and questions we hope to answer from the data.
- **GitHub**: Our GitHub will include commits and branches from all team members.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Our MLM will take data from our database and provide output labels from our input data.
- **Database**: Our database will be connected ot the machine learning model and have sample data that will mimic the expected final database.
- **Dashboard**: We will utilize Tableau to analyze and visualize our observed and predicted birth data.
